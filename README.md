# MCP Servers

This repository contains Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for scientific research applications.

## Overview

This collection of MCP servers provides tools and resources for various scientific research domains. Each server is designed to interface with specific scientific APIs, data sources, or computational services.

## Directory Structure

* `/servers` - Individual MCP server implementations
* `/configs` - Configuration files and templates
* `/examples` - Example usage and documentation
* `/tests` - Test suites for the servers

## Getting Started

1. Choose the appropriate MCP server for your research needs
2. Follow the setup instructions in the server's README
3. Configure the server with necessary API keys and settings
4. Add the server configuration to your Claude settings

## Contributing

To add a new MCP server:

1. Create a new directory under `/servers`
2. Implement the server using the MCP SDK
3. Include comprehensive documentation
4. Add configuration examples
5. Provide usage examples
